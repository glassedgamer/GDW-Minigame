Minigame for Game Design Workshop

## Car with a Gun
The title is self-explanatory, you control a car and shoot stuff with a gun mounted on top of your car. Protect The Wallâ„¢ from an oncoming horde of zombies for as long as possible. Don't drive into the water or zombies, though, or you will die.

## Controls
- **WASD and Arrow Keys -** Drive
- **Space -** Shoot

## Devlog
Car with a Gun was a fun game to make. The idea for the game originated from the first two Create with Code tutorials that Unity put out. The first involved learning how to make a car drive, and the second was how to shoot stuff or something. It was simple enough to combine those two features together, I just had to figure out a gameplay loop. I ended up landing on a zombie invasion style game, where a bunch of zombies spawn in randomly and move forward (this was something that went along with the shooting mechanic in the second Unity Create with Code). The last little bit that I added was a wall that could lose health if a zombie hits it, then a game over screen for when the wall loses health, you hit a zombie, or you drive out of bounds, and then a simple main menu as well. It took around two weeks to finish, so it's nowhere near perfect, but the process of making it was fun.
